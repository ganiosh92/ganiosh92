<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ani</h1>
<p align="left">I'm an experienced Data Scientist with a history of applying data science to solve business problems in the field of manufacturing, insurance, and retail. In my recent role at Target, I led a global team of 7 Data Analysts and 3 Data Engineers and built an anomaly detection model using K-means, effectively sifting through a massive dataset of 24 billion records to find outliers. Outside of work, I like to apply my data science skills to tackle personal challenges. For instance, I conducted an A/B test to inform my car purchase decision based on front grille design and developed a sophisticated national park recommendation system, considering proximity, seasonal factors, and preferred activities to help me choose which national parks to visit when.</p>
